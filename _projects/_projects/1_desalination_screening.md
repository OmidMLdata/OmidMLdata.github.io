* Developed a surrogate machine learning model trained on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to rapidly predict desalination performance (water flux and ion rejection) of 2D membranes, significantly reducing computational time and cost.
* Identified key physical and structural features—including pore geometry, atomic charges, applied pressure, and membrane mechanics—and demonstrated that ensemble ML models can accurately forecast desalination metrics, accelerating material screening for water purification applications.
