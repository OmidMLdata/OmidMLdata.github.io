title: A Generalizable Computational-to-Experimental
Agentic LLM Framework for Polymer Design
Optimization in Separation Technologies
description: We present a systematic framework that leverages Model Context Protocol
through Large Language Model (MCP-LLM) agent architecture to transform baseline
polymers into high-performance separation materials through molecular refinement.

* Developed an autonomous LLM-driven framework that iteratively designs and optimizes graphene nanopores for desalination, using pretrained deep learning models to predict water flux and ion rejection.
* Implemented a chain-of-thought prompting and function-calling strategy enabling LLM agents to generate manufacturable pore geometries that maximize water permeability while maintaining high salt rejection.
