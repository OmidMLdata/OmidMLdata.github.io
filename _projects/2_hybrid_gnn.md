* Built and fine-tuned hybrid GNN models on the NF10k molecular dataset to accurately predict rejection rates, leveraging message-passing architectures and pretrained embeddings for structural feature learning.
* Improved model performance and robustness through ensemble evaluation, Gaussian noise injection, and output-level ensembling, achieving higher R2 and lower RMSE.
