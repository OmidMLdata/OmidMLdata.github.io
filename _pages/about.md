I’m an AI/ML researcher driven by the challenge of designing intelligent systems that push scientific and engineering frontiers. I work with GNNs, generative models, and LLM agents to solve problems in molecular design, materials science, and simulation-based optimization. Whether developing pretrained GNNs for chemical property prediction, building LLM-guided agents to improve water desalination, or creating robust ML pipelines, I enjoy blending theory, modeling, and real-world experimentation to deliver meaningful impact.
