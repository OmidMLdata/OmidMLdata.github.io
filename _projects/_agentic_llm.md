* Developed an autonomous LLM-driven framework that iteratively designs and optimizes graphene nanopores for desalination, using pretrained deep learning models to predict water flux and ion rejection.
* Implemented a chain-of-thought prompting and function-calling strategy enabling LLM agents to generate manufacturable pore geometries that maximize water permeability while maintaining high salt rejection.
